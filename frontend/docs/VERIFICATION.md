## Structural evidence

- Original supplied folder inventoried: 203 files.
- Original UI/workflow source: 9,817-line `App.tsx`.
- Refactored Expo entry: 7 lines.
- Refactored composition root: 1,026 lines.
- Refactored source: 176 files.
- Bundled assets: 13 files.
- Preserved top-level routes: 36.
- Preserved directly addressable deep preview states: 32.
- Runtime preview adapters use deterministic local behavior and do not call `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, WebSocket or EventSource.

## Visual QA

The fresh web export was served locally and inspected in a real browser.

### Compact mobile: 390 × 844

- All 36 top-level routes were opened through the route preview harness.
- Every route rendered; no broken images were found.
- `welcome` decorative overflow was detected, fixed and rechecked at `scrollWidth === 390`.
- `chat` compact action-bar overflow was detected, fixed and rechecked at `scrollWidth === 390`.
- Browser console recheck showed no warnings or errors on the corrected routes.

### Desktop web: 1440 × 1000

The highest-density and representative destinations were inspected: `home`, `profile`, `chat`, `gifts`, `events`, `pricing`, and `profileSetup`.

- Each rendered at `scrollWidth === 1440`.
- No broken images were found.
- Responsive desktop navigation and content framing remained intact.

## Public preview

Public URL: `https://destinyone-complete-frontend-20260807.shivay247.chatgpt.site/`

- Hosted publicly through Sites; Netlify is not used.
- Independent HTTP request returned status `200` and content type `text/html`.
- Live mobile check at 390 × 844: `scrollWidth === 390`, zero broken images, DestinyOne home content rendered.
- Live desktop check at 1440 × 1000: `scrollWidth === 1440`, zero broken images, DestinyOne profile content rendered.
- Browser diagnostics returned no console warnings or errors.
- Mobile and desktop live screenshots were visually inspected after deployment.

## Archive verification

Final archive: `DestinyOne-Frontend-Employee-Handoff-2026-08-08.zip`

- Contains the exact employee-readable source, assets, configuration, lockfile and documentation used for the final public version.
- Excludes `node_modules`, `.expo`, `dist`, `dist-ios`, `dist-android`, caches, `.git`, secrets and temporary files.
- Archive paths are rooted under one clearly named project folder.
- `unzip -t` completed without errors.
